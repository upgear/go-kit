# Go Kit

This is a collection of Go libraries that we use on most projects at upgear.

The packages here are intended to augment the standard library for common
tasks and to make it easy to adhere to http standards, etc.

These libraries are intended to be opinionated about things like logging,
configuration, etc. This is to help bring standardization to
the codebases that use them.

## Assumptions

- Configuration is done via the environment
